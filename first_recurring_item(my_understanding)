# google question
# given an array = [2,5,1,2,3,5,1,2,4]
# should run 2

# given an array = [2,1,1,2,3,5,1,2,4]
# should run 1

# given an array = [2,3,4,5]
# should run undefined


# simple solution - as it is scanning from start to end, it sees the duplicates

# 🧠: we set the numbers to true within the dictionary since its the first time seeing them
# when we see the number again, a duplicate, we return the item due to the if statement
def frc_1(array):
    dictionary = dict()
    # looping thru array we pass in
    for item in array:
        if item in dictionary:
            print(item)
            return item
        else:
            dictionary[item] = True
    return None


array_1 = [2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4]

    frc = None

    # i is less than length, so increment j

        j = i+1
        # now that we're incrementing j
        # as long as j has not hit the end, do something
        while (j < l):
            # if duplicate found, make the new length of the array be the value of what was found
            # index 5 is not less than length 5, so it falses out and terminates?
            if array[i] == array[j]:
                l = j
                # we save the value that recurred for later use

                j += 1
        # i moves forward, j resets to just ahead of i and loops again

    # since we did find a match, we jump out of that inner while loop
